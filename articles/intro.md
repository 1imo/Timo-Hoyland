I'm T. Hoyland. Nottingham. Solutions Consultant—teams, reliability, cost. I run [NottInfra](https://nottinfra.co.uk), an infrastructure consultancy.

The work that sticks isn't the tech. It's the teams and the conditions that let them deliver. I've worked across agency, enterprise, and client-facing IT—digital signage, pipelines, logging, Windows Server, M365, FMECAs for exec and finance. The pattern that shows up: the stack is often fine. The structure around it—backlog discipline, alerting, who owns what, how decisions get made—is where things go wrong. That gap costs people sleep and money.

Supporting teams means creating space for good decisions. Reducing unnecessary risk, keeping costs predictable, building systems that don't surprise people at 3am. Technical depth matters, but it only lands when the conditions are right. I write about that here.
